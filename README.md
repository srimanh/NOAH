NOAH is not another agent that blindly runs commands. It behaves like a senior
sysadmin: it inspects real telemetry (disk, memory, processes, services, logs)
**before** it acts, explains what will change, **asks before anything dangerous**,
and **hard-blocks the catastrophic**. Cross-platform — Linux & macOS.

## 🕹️ Usage

```bash
noah                              # interactive AI-SysAdmin console (TUI)
noah "install docker and verify"  # send a task on startup
noah doctor                       # full machine health report (no LLM)
noah benchmark                    # run the task suite → md + json reports
noah --dry-run "free up space"    # preview; make no changes
noah --print "show big files"     # single-shot, no TUI
noah --rpc                        # headless JSON-RPC (embed NOAH)
noah --list-models                # available models (✓ = ready)
noah --check "rm -rf /"           # see how the safety gate classifies a command
noah --log                        # print the audit trail
noah playbooks                    # list curated multi-step recipes
noah run harden-ssh               # preview a playbook (safe); add --yes to apply
noah history                      # what NOAH changed (reversible ops timeline)
noah undo                         # revert the last reversible change
noah update                       # upgrade to the latest published version
noah version                      # print version (and notify if an update exists)
```

NOAH checks for new releases once a day and shows a gentle banner when one is
available — just run `noah update` to upgrade.

**In-console commands**

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `/doctor` | full machine health report |
| `/model` | pick a model (dropdown) |
| `/login` · `/logout` | connect / disconnect a provider |
| `/caveman` | token-saver terse mode |
| `/compact` | compress context to save tokens |
| `/history` · `/undo` | see/revert what NOAH changed |
| `/extensions` | list loaded extensions + health |
| `/audit` · `/clear` · `/help` · `/quit` | … |

---

## 💡 What it can do

- **"Install Docker"** → checks disk/memory/existing setup → recommends → installs → verifies.
- **"Why is my laptop slow?"** → root-cause from real top processes + memory pressure, with severity.
- **"Free up space"** → finds large files & stale caches → suggests **safe** cleanup → confirms.
- **"How healthy is my machine?"** → full report with prioritized actions.

---

## 📜 Playbooks

Playbooks are curated, multi-step recipes — each step runs through the same
safety gate and ops ledger as any other action, so the **whole playbook is
reversible**. They are **safe by default**: `noah run <id>` only *previews*;
add `--yes` to apply.

```bash
noah playbooks            # update-all · harden-ssh · setup-python
noah run harden-ssh       # preview the steps (no changes)
noah run harden-ssh --yes # apply — then `noah undo` reverts it step-by-step
```

Each step is recorded against the playbook's turn, so the entire run can be
rolled back as a unit. Author your own as a small JSON/YAML file (schema =
`id`, `title`, `description`, `steps[]` of `package`/`service`/`file` actions).

---

## 📑 Black Box (incident reports)

NOAH can turn everything it recorded — the audit log, the ops ledger, telemetry —
into a clean **incident report**: a chronological timeline plus a summary of what
changed and what's reversible. Sign it for a tamper-evident, verifiable record.

```bash
noah report                                  # Markdown report to stdout
noah report --out incident.md                # write it to a file
noah report --sign noah.key --out incident.json   # signed (ed25519)
noah report verify incident.json             # ✓ authentic and unaltered
```

---

## 🛰️ Fleet (many machines)

Drive a whole fleet from one NOAH. It uses **your existing SSH** (no new auth, no
daemon, no open ports) and fans a command out to every node concurrently — one
broken host never blocks the rest. The same safety gate applies fleet-wide: a
catastrophic command is refused before it reaches a single node.

```bash
noah fleet add web1 10.0.0.1 --user deploy   # register a node
noah fleet                                    # list nodes
noah fleet doctor                             # health-check every node
noah fleet run "uptime"                       # fan a command out (gated)
```

---

## 🩺 Sentinel (proactive health)

Sentinel watches your machine in the background and alerts you the moment a
problem **appears** — disk filling, memory pressure, a service that died — not
every tick while it lingers (anti-alert-fatigue by design). Alerts go to a native
desktop notification and `~/.noah/sentinel.log`.

```bash
noah watch                 # check every 60s; Ctrl-C to stop
noah watch --interval 10   # check every 10s
```

---

## 🧠 Memory (Recall)

NOAH remembers your machine and preferences — **locally** — and injects the most
relevant facts into its context, so it behaves like it already knows your setup.
Machine facts (OS, package manager) are auto-captured from telemetry; you teach it
the rest. It's fully inspectable and wipeable — privacy by design.

```bash
noah remember "I deploy with pm2 and use pnpm"   # teach a durable fact
noah memory                                       # see everything NOAH knows
noah memory forget <id>                           # delete one fact
noah memory forget all                            # wipe it all
```

---

## 🧩 Skills (marketplace)

Skills are shareable capability packages (bundled playbooks). Before NOAH runs
one, it passes **three trust gates**:

1. **Signature** — the author signs with an ed25519 key; a tampered or unsigned
   skill is rejected.
2. **Permissions** — the skill declares what it needs (`package`/`service`/`file`);
   if any step reaches for an undeclared tool, install is refused (least privilege).
3. **The trunk** — once installed, every action still flows through the safety
   gate + ops ledger, so it stays gated and **reversible**.

```bash
noah skills keygen .                       # author: make an ed25519 keypair
noah skills sign manifest.json noah-skill.key > my.skill.json
noah skills verify my.skill.json           # signature + permission check
noah skills install my.skill.json          # gated install → ~/.noah/skills
noah skills                                # list installed skills
noah run <skill-playbook>                  # run it (gated + reversible)
```

---

## 🔌 Extensions

NOAH ships built-in provider shims and auto-discovers your own extensions from
`~/.noah/extensions` (user) and `./extensions` (project). Each is a module with a
default-exported extension factory; a broken extension is **isolated** and never
blocks the others. Loaded extensions and their health show in `/extensions` and `noah doctor`.

```js
// ~/.noah/extensions/hello.mjs
export default function (noah) {
  noah.on("before_agent_start", (event) => ({ systemPrompt: event.systemPrompt }));
}
```

---

## 🧩 Embed it (SDK)

```ts
import { createNoahSession } from "noah-agent/sdk";

const { session } = await createNoahSession({ dryRun: false, autoYes: false });
session.subscribe((e) => {
  if (e.type === "message_update" && e.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta")
    process.stdout.write(e.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
});
await session.prompt("install htop and start it");
session.dispose();
```

Also exported: `classify` (safety policy) · `platform` (OS adapter) ·
`collectSnapshot` / `assessHealth` (telemetry) · `buildNoahRuntime` (RPC).

## 🏗️ How it works

```
  Your request ── reads telemetry (system · logs) ── analyzes impact
        │
        ▼
  🛡️ SAFETY GATE     classify → deny / confirm / allow   + audit trail
        │
        ▼
  🧰 TOOLS  bash · files · package · service · network · system · logs
        │
        ▼
  🖥️ PLATFORM ADAPTER  Linux (apt/dnf/pacman/zypper · systemd) · macOS (brew · launchd)
        │
        ▼
       Host OS
```

Under the hood NOAH runs on a battle-tested agentic runtime for the reasoning loop,
sessions, streaming, and multi-provider transport — then adds everything that makes
it NOAH: the OS tool layer, the telemetry/health engine, and the safety gate.

### 🔒 Safety classification

| Verdict | Examples | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `deny` | `rm -rf /`, fork bomb, `mkfs`, `dd of=/dev/disk`, `shutdown` | Hard-blocked, no override |
| `confirm` | installs, `sudo`, deletes, writes, service/network changes | Asks first |
| `allow` | `ls`, `grep`, telemetry reads, redirects to `/dev/null` | Runs freely |

### 🔐 Supply-chain integrity

NOAH never inherits the release cadence — or any compromise — of its third-party
runtime:

- **Exact pins** — the core runtime is locked to one vetted version (no `^`/`~`).
- **Bundled** — that vetted runtime ships *inside* the npm tarball
  (`bundleDependencies`), so `npm i -g noah-agent` never re-downloads it from the
  registry. A malicious upstream release simply can't reach your machine.
- **Verified** — `npm run verify:deps` (and `noah --verify-deps`) walks the whole
  install tree and fails on any drifted or missing copy. It runs automatically in
  `prepublishOnly`, so a tampered tree can never be published.

```bash
noah --verify-deps   # ✓ core dependencies verified — all pinned versions intact.
```

### ↩️ Reversible by design

Every change NOAH makes is recorded as a **transaction** in an append-only ledger
(`~/.noah/ops.jsonl`). Command-style changes (package install/remove, service
enable/disable/start/stop) store their **inverse**; file changes (`write`/`edit`)
store a **content-addressed snapshot** of the original bytes. You never have to
remember what changed or how to undo it:

```bash
noah history   # timeline: [reversible] / [undone] / [not reversible]
noah undo      # replay the inverse of the last reversible op (gated)
noah undo <id> # revert a specific operation
```

**Time Machine** — in the console, every message is a checkpoint. `/rewind` (or
`/rewind <n>`) rolls the machine back to the state it was in before that message,
then restores the message text so you can edit and re-run it. `/checkpoints` lists
them. So if a request changed your system in a way you didn't want, you scroll
back, rewind, and the filesystem follows.

So if NOAH hardens your `sshd_config`, `noah undo` restores the *exact* prior file
— and a file NOAH created is removed again. Irreversible actions (e.g. `update`,
`restart`) are still recorded and clearly flagged “not reversible”, no surprises.
